<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

## ‚ö†Ô∏èThis is NOT an official tool from Cisco/Splunk - use at your own risk!!‚ö†Ô∏è
Splunky AI Chat is a free tool for Splunk SEs and SAs to help them get help with Sales and Discovery meetings with RSMs and customers.  Splunky can provide guided sales motions to help maximize everyone's time.  

**Splunky will:**
- Guide you through sales motions from prep-meetings, live meetings and to closing deals

---

### Prerequisites

If using the AIaaS (Default) you will need a Web Browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and an active internet connection.

If you are wanting to host your own, download and install LM Studio on your on hardware like a GPU-enabled AI server or on your Cisco-issued laptop.
Your choice of GGUF LLMs from Huggingface.co will determine the quality and speed of the AI output.  Larger models tend to be more accurate and concise, but slower output generation and requires >20GB of VRAM.  Nvidia GPUs w/ 12GB of VRAM is the minimum for decent quality output.  

LM Studio supports inferencing on CPU, GPU (Intel, AMD, Nvidia) as well as Mac M-series GPUs.
